I am trying to get success in basic commands of git and git hubs. This is a new file to try again. I am learning a lot than before but still I have some confusion while pushing code to remote repository (repo).This is practicing the third time editing the local repo. to push into central or githup repository. 
"This is a fourth time practicing local repo into central repo."
